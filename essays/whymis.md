My name is Kristen and I recently changed my major from healthcare to business. I have always had an interest in business and the job description entails. Not knowing much about what specialization I should get into, I decided to give MIS a try. I believe that I made the right decision, as learning information systems is becoming increasingly crucial in all aspects of the business world. 

My goals in this class are to learn as much as I can about programming and to develop my coding skills to where it needs to be. I am excited to start learning about the basic foundations of MIS.
