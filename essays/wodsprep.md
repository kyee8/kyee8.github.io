The WOD that I recently performed was Invoice2, where we had to take the previous html from Invoice1 and modified if with an algorithm to help determine the shipping cost. As we used the html code from the previous WOD (Invoice 1), there were also a few minor mistakes that had to be fixed. 

Overall, I felt pretty good about this WOD. The previous Invoice1 WOD was definitely a lot tougher, but it made me feel more comfortable and prepared to tackle this WOD. On my first try, I performed Invoice2 without watching the screencast. It took me an Sd time of 18 minutes and the code looked different compared to the professor’s code, but the outcome looked pretty similar. Before my second attempt, I watched and followed the screencast. I was glad I did because it helped me realize that I forgot to take out some of the hard-code (from the previous WOD) and replace it with “document.write()” with the correct variables inside the parenthesis. To add, I realized that I added the if statements differently, probably in the more unorganized way. Instead of creating a comment section for “Compute Shipping” and writing my if/else if/else statements underneath it, I typed it in script tags underneath the “Shipping” title. I realized that this way was less efficient and not as organized. My second try took me around 12 minutes so I tried again and got it down to a Rx time of 8 minutes. Using the //comment tags helped me locate the areas I needed to find faster and I feel like it really helped me throughout the WOD. The area I spent the most time on was the if statements, as I kept forgetting the {} curly braces, setting my time back a little further.

I actually did not prepare for this WOD and tried it out without watching screencast. Compared to the last WOD, I feel like I went into this one a little more blindly. For example, I feel like reviewing past presentations to refresh my memory on the structure of if statements could have saved me a lot of time on this WOD. For the next WOD, I should take more time to read the instructions and look back on past presentations/notes to help me familiarize myself with the WOD before I jump into it.
